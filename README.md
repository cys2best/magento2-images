# docker-magento2

[![Docker Automated Build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/sensson/magento2.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/sensson/magento2/) [![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/sensson/magento2.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/sensson/magento2/)

A base Magento 2 image that can be used to scale in production. This can
be used in combination with MySQL and Redis. It is opinionated and includes
support for Composer, ionCube, Redis, OPcache, and the required PHP modules
for a basic Magento installation.

It does not include Magento.

# Usage

An example `Dockerfile`

```
FROM sensson/magento2
COPY src/ /var/www/html/
```

More details can be found in [Magento2 and Docker](DOCKER.md).

# Persistent storage

The container assumes you do not store data in a folder along with the
application. Don't use Docker volumes for scale. Use CephFS, GlusterFS or
integrate with S3 or S3-compatible services such as [Fuga.io](https://fuga.io).

Include the port mapping in `URI` if you run your shop on a local development
environment, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to run certain actions at certain points in the startup
procedure without having to rewrite `entrypoint.sh`. You can use hooks to
import data, preconfigure settings or run other scripts that need to run
each startup sequence.

Hook point   | Location                 | Description
----------   | ---------                | -----------
Pre install  | `/hooks/pre_install.sh`  | Runs before an installation or update.
Pre compile  | `/hooks/pre_compile.sh`  | Runs before code compilation starts.
Post install | `/hooks/post_install.sh` | Runs after Magento has been installed.

You need to `COPY` any hooks to this location yourself.

## Development mode

Setting `RUNTYPE` to `development` will turn on public error reports. Anything
else will leave it off. It will also set `display_errors` to on in PHP. This is
set to off by default.

A basic `docker-compose.yml` has been provided to help during the development
of this image.
